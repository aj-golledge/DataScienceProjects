More reserved, less likely to put himself at risk for others, that is until the reintroduction of Bail Organa. Bail Organa requests the help of Kenobi after his adopted daughter, Leia Organa, is kidnapped from her home.

Put in charge by Darth Vader after the murder of the Grand Inquisitor, Reva sets out to hunt down Kenobi in order to gain what is rightfully hers through his capture. Darth Vader, a creature of the darkness fueled by his hatred of Kenobi, is hell bent on the capture and torture of Kenobi by using any means necessary. This leads to one of the most gruesome scenes in Star Wars history, to which I will not reveal.

Sad time to be a Star Wars fan.", "date": "May 30, 2022", "score": 3}, {"author": "Xilba", "review": "Based on the opening two episodes, Disney continues to make hash of the original trilogy through needless 'gap-filling' supplements to the Skywalker saga. Here we have a decidedly unheroic Obi-Wan whose pessimism is largely attributed to his failure to save an apprentice he knew from the start was a potentially dangerous Force-wielder. So, for the second time, following Luke's childish abandonment of the Resistance in the Disney sequels, a noble figure from the original trilogy is laid low by dubious attempts to 'deepen' the character. Why couldn't Obi-Wan have been conflicted about his duty to Luke on some insignificant Outer Rim planet when he could have been helping the emerging Rebellion? But no, the show's creators went for an easy 'redemption' character arc that frustrates our expectations for no good reason.\n\nWhat's worse is the story doesn't compel Obi-Wan to figure things out. During the initial kidnapping plot, sheer coincidence leads him to the brigands holding ten-year-old Leia. A child grifter approaches him and directs him to a supposed Jedi just because he looks lost. Then the fake Jedi tells Obi-Wan where to go when he could have just as easily lied. (Later on, coincidence assumes an even greater role when the fake Jedi helps Obi-Wan for reasons entirely unearned but necessary to force a climactic confrontation.) There's no detective work required of Obi-Wan, just walking around, waiting for others to tell him what to do next.\n\nIn terms of acting, while Ewan McGregor gives a creditable, though not especially nuanced performance, the dialogue doesn't do him any favors as characters routinely speak in rote, comic book shorthand, simply announcing their feelings and motives. The rest of the cast seems game but out of their depth, particularly Moses Ingraham and the other paper-thin Inquisitors and the hapless tyke playing a precocious and wholly unlikeable version of Leia.\n\nNot even the action and effects can save this show from the 'barely watchable' category. In the first two episodes alone we're treated to not one but two chase scenes in which the aforementioned ten-year-old outruns grown-ups who should've scooped her up in seconds. The Jedi defending the Padawans in the prologue doesn't need more than a single stroke to cut down any of her foes. The Inquisitors lose their initial prey because he Force-lowers a bit of awning. Obi-Wan exchanges blaster fire across rooftops in the most boring fashion imaginable. There's virtually no suspense or tension to any of it.\n\nOne additional annoyance is that the show seems intent on introducing new contradictions to the Skywalker saga. How is it a third-rate Inquisitor is able to determine Obi-Wan's association with Bail Organa and infer Leia's importance by simply reviewing Imperial records? If that's the case, why isn't Bail Organa and by extension, Obi-Wan, hounded by the Inquisitors and/or Darth Vader up until the beginning of Ep. 4? Why doesn't Leia ever mention to Luke that she had an adventure with Obi-Wan when she was a child? You'd think something like that would have been a comfort when Luke was grieving over his mentor's death. Why is Darth Vader's identity as Anakin Skywalker known to low-level Inquisitors when it's apparently unknown to the Rebel Alliance at the beginning of Ep. 4, including Bail Organa, who actually knew Anakin before his heel turn? Rumors like that don't travel as far as Alderaan?\n\nThe sad fact is that what the franchise lost in the transition to Disney is the understanding that these characters are archetypes in the same sense as figures from mythology. Not that they can't be complex, but in the main, they should act from a consistent set of well-defined principles. The Mandolorian hinted at a return to this understanding with its early Sergio Leone-style western episodes but ultimately it, too, got mired in the wrongheaded decision to revisit elements of the original Skywalker saga that don't require or even deserve explanation.

In hard contrast, the second sister from the Jedi:Fallen Order was also a powerful woman of color but her char was an awesome design, dark brooding and believable. Sith are famous for their iconic over-the top designs and you have the three inquisitors, a crazy bald sharp-tooth sinister grand-inquisitor, some kind of crazy glowing-eyed sci-fi samaurai and the third sister .. looks like they literally just pulled someone off the street and put a black leather top on them. Like give her some eye shadow or some eye effects or something to make her look like an actual sith and not just a pretender. Then when they try to make her look cool they are like doing over the top unnecessary jumps that make her look more like a carnival performer than a sith.\n\nSecondly we have Leias char, played by a 9 year old pretending to be a 10 year old who looks like a 6 year old. Children are classically annoying in film as they are not as experienced as their older counterparts, which is why they are most often portrayed by older actors. She's just not interesting or believable. Sure she's cute and that is fine for a minor role as a cute little girl, not as a lead trying to carry the show. So far there is no reason I can see why they couldent have jumped ahead 15 years instead of 10 and shown Leia as a cool teenager played by more mature actor with talent to carry the show and able to maintain a more brooding tone to keep with the rest of the show.\n\nThen you look at the whole show, it doesn't know what its trying to do. Its got dark brooding adult elements, it turns into a silly comedy at times, and during Leias scenes it becomes like a lighthearted children's show. Its trying to do too many things at once and has no clear underlying element to hold it all together.\n\nMcGregors scenes are well done and exactly what I expected. If they gave him more development and focused on him IN HIS OWN SHOW while only briefly showing these no-name actors, the show could have been great. It still has potential hypothetically if the untalented no name actors take a backseat and let Obi have his show.

They did this with horrid writing, no consistency, and exceedingly poor acting. Petulance and a resting **** face does not convey the menace that the writers and Moses Ingram seem to think it does.\nThe second episode was horrendous. Full of plot conveniences and \"just becauses\" that would embarrass the writers of The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nThe entire rescue was preposterous. The Leia chase scene in this one made the one in Ep 1 look like high cinema but lasted a full 10 minutes. We got Reva being petulant again and contradicting and defying her Sith (in all but name) commander and suffering no repercussions. Then we get Batman Reva observing the city from a rooftop with the RBF still firmly in place at the right place at precisely the right time to catch up to Leia and Obi, then a laughably bad force enabled parcor dash to intercept. She ends up extracting Kenobi's new location from a fake Jedi using her super, totally better than Kylo's, information extractor mind power in about five seconds (this powerful ability is why the Inquisitors tolerate her insubordination it is explained) So why did she not use it on Owen in Ep 1? Kenobi was literally 20 feet away.\nShe is confronted again by the Grand Inquisitor, the same character that appears in the Show \"Star Wars Rebels\" as the main antagonist set four or five years after these events (Star Wars Canon), but he cops an attitude so Reva runs him through.\nAnyway, Reva finds Kenobi. She dialogs that Vader is alive, and therefore Anakin is alive. I won't judge this as harshly as others. I know Vader killed anyone that knew this secret, but maybe she saw him in the temple during Order 66, we'll see.

All of that is on display, but the worst offense in the series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" is how it handles its namesake.\n\nIn this series, the venerable Jedi is now a deeply fearful man, consumed with regret, who has lost seemingly all of the calm dedication and martial prowess that was his hallmark for literally every other film and television series featuring him up to this point. The knight who unflinchingly stood against Sith Lords, bounty hunters, literal armies of opposition and Darth Vader himself, is now seemingly incapable of anything more than trading some blaster fire and running for his life in between panic attacks.\n\nWe are supposed to understand that in the 10 years since his last film appearance, Obi-Wan has cut of all connection to the Force, ceased any form of training and has simply been hiding out -- thus, we are to believe, his jarring ineffectiveness. He even tells a potential ally that all hope is lost; that they should lay low in perpetuity, effectively doing nothing to help anyone. But this character re-write doesn't actually work when we consider that A) Kenobi's mission - which he has been quietly awaiting - is to train a young Luke Skywalker as a Jedi B) he, Kenobi, has been given additional skills to hone from Master Yoda in preparation for the years ahead and C) such a meek surrender to tyranny and evil goes against everything we've known about the character for roughly 40 years now. It's an ill-conceived cop out from the writing room that just doesn't convince.\n\nBy the third episode, when the former Jedi is called upon to summon at least a glimpse of the skill and valor that he demonstrated so routinely years before, there is almost nothing there.

The wealth of available villains and possible plot lines the producers had to work with was endless. There was no way this could be bad. They had Ewan McGregor, eventually got Hayden as well! After the trailer dropped I was so excited. So they are going full on Vader/Inqisitors! Great! Watched the first episode and it was fine really. They are setting up a redemption arc for Kenobi. He\u2019s lost his edge and is out of touch with the force. Fine. Makes sense.\nLeia storyline is introduced\u2026 okay, I kinda like it! This will be cool! Girl seems closer to 7 years old than 10, but okay. Honestly don\u2019t mind the girl actor, she\u2019s fine and emotes some of that Leia cockiness. First sign of trouble I see in the show is when \u201cFlea\u201d shows up as a heavy and he is just awful. The ensuing foot chase is badly choreographed and filmed. The \u201cPirate\u201d actors clearly pause and stop at various moments to make sure they don\u2019t catch up to the child actor. It\u2019s just bad. Ok\u2026 I\u2019ll forgive that if the show just keeps getting better.\nCity chase scene is better and events that occur here are good. Kenobi is tasked with not using the force or reveal his location so makes sense. The Reva parkour didn\u2019t bother me. Thought is was cool. The Inquisitors meet at some point and there is trouble in the ranks and a challenge is imminent. Fine. Grand inquisitor is cool and genuinely menacing, the Asian inquisitor and Reva are borderline for me. One is over the top \u201cevil\u201d and growls all his lines, and Reva just seems to get angry, yell, and then lash out. She does it every single appearance in the show through 2 episodes. No nuance to the character for how much focus is on her.\nAnyways, Kenobi is forced to use the force to save Leia and it feels like a BIG moment and I\u2019m excited. This is it. His awakening! Nope. Next scene he is just magically at street level with Leia. Even my wife, who was just watching because I was watching it, said, \u201chow did he get down there so fast?\u201d Not a big deal, but why not show a scene of Kenobi force leaping off the building. Would have been cool. I\u2019m still not complaining though.\nSkip to scene where Kenobi and Reva arrive at the cargo hangar nearly simultaneously. Kenobi struggles with revealing himself at first but we are going to see our first saber battle! It\u2019s the perfect set up. Reva would make a perfect first challenger for Kenobi. She is brash and overconfident. Kenobi will easily thrash her and at the last moment the other inquisitors rush in and save her. Kenobi and Leia escape and Leia is completely in awe of Kenobi and fully trusts him now. The Inquisitors rush to their ship to give chase but lose the cargo ship as it jumps to light speed. The episode ends with the inquisitors radioing the fleet that they need that ships coordinates!\n\nExcept nothing in that last paragraph actually happens. Here is what does and it\u2019s where the show starts worrying me for real. Reva comes in the hangar, senses Kenobi is there, and starts taunting him. Kenobi hides. Why? It\u2019s just him and her at that point. He has been discovered. He knows it. Everyone knows he\u2019s here. But ok, whatever. I wanted a fight but obviously the writers really want to drive home that Kenobi is broken and afraid, even though they had already set up a big moment with music and fanfare when he saved Leia with the force.\n\nReva taunts Kenobi more and reveals Anakin is alive and he is Darth Vader. Kenobi cowers and is shaken. That\u2019s fine and believable. It would have been far more impactful in the scene had Kenobi started fighting Reva, had her on the ropes, and THEN she reveals it. Kenobi reels and loses focus and narrowly escapes Reva. Would have been so cool. Instead Reva just stabs the Inquisitor and kills him (confirmed, he\u2019s dead). I guess this messes with canon continuity, but honestly. I don\u2019t care about that stuff if improves the story. They can always retcon that later. Problem is it was a weird moment and lacked the impact the writers thought it would.\n\nThe 3rd episode is a disaster with the exception of one scene where Leia asked Kenobi what the force feels like. His explanation of turning the lights on when scared in a dark room is BEAUTIFUL and poetic! Amazing writing there. Seriously. Great moment.\n\nThe rest of the episode is a series of head scratchers and \u201comg why\u201d moments. First, there are several moments where the director assumed the audience were idiots. 1. The cargo ship escapes, no pursuit? 2. The stormtrooper checkpoint. No Jedi mind trick? Walk around laser barrier? 3. Vader and fuel spill, Kenobi escape. Vader just used force to extinguish fire a second earlier, but now he can\u2019t? And again, just walk around it!\nIt\u2019s not nitpicking when these issues are so glaring.

Don't get me wrong, this still takes place in that post-RotS, pre-A New Hope safe space that Kathleen Kennedy seems absolutely terrified to move away from, but at the same time it feels tailor-made for those who grew up with that overly-hated second trilogy. It's the Star Wars content I've been most looking forward to for some time now. My favorite character in this massive, media-spanning franchise has always been Obi-Wan, and given what a tiny part he had in the OT that is in no small part due to Ewan McGregor's performance. So getting to see him step back into that role, alongside other returning faces from those same movies, hit all the right nostalgic notes for me while also providing a story with some actual significance in the canon due to the way it shows how the legendary Jedi went from being the broken man we saw at the end of Episode III to the reinvigorated wise mentor who would lead Luke on the first steps of his journey in Episode IV.\n\nSo this isn't just dusting off a fan favorite for a quick good time Solo-style, but actually provides the last essential piece of history for one of the franchise's most important personas. Kenobi's entire arc here sees him forced to face the demons of his past in a struggle that's as much internal as it is external. A conflict that ultimately allows him to rediscover a sense of peace, understanding, and his faith. It carries profound themes of self-forgiveness (particularly if what happened wasn't truly your fault), letting go of trauma, and forging a new, healthier path. I hear a lot of people complaining about Third Sister Reva, but while it may be a bit redundant her inclusion really helps to hammer that message home even further.\n\nAll the underlying depth of its subtext wouldn't mean much however if the miniseries wasn't fun to watch. Luckily the core dynamic between the titular hero and the child-aged version of a very familiar princess is absolutely charming, and there were still plenty of tense moments that had my heart skipping a beat despite the fact that its prequel nature meant I knew who was in real danger or not. This period in the saga is also excellently brought to life with an appropriate tone of hopelessness and desperation similar to Rogue One as the good people in the galaxy far, far away are forced into hiding or subjugation to survive being hunted.\n\nBy far the greatest source of excitement though has got to be Darth Vader. It's been touted across countless films, shows, and literature how those under the Empire's rule lived in complete terror of his immense power, but this is the first piece of the fiction I've come across that's allowed us to see it for ourselves. The Sith lord is simply terrifying here, performing feats straight out of The Force Unleashed video game. Something made all the sweeter thanks to the unfairly treated Hayden Christensen coming back to don the iconic helmet. The action is of a grittier nature than we typically get from the brand as well, with lightsabers getting forsaken for some old fashioned fisticuffs and displays of the force that are more massive and bombastic than anything in any of the 9 films prior.\n\nIt's refreshing to receive a project that seems built from the ground up for the portion of the community that's been largely ignored since George Lucas sold the rights to his space opera baby. Especially since it provides the final vital chapter in the history of its protagonist. Those \"fans\" who have been upset about everything since the first two-thirds of Return of the Jedi are better off passing, as this serves as a continuation to a part of the saga they have no appreciation for anyways. Yet, for those of us who actually like Star Wars? There are a few minor niggles with things like characters inexplicably choosing to not wipe out certain threats or how apparently taking a laser sword to the gut isn't fatal anymore, but at long last we have been given the full picture of Obi-Wan's life, and that is worth celebrating.", "date": "Jul 29, 2022", "score": 9}, {"author": "JazGalaxy", "review": "I am SHOCKED that this show isn't getting ripped to shreds.

It has bad writing, some continuity errors and inconsistencies. For example Obi Wan is sometimes a weak coward and other times a badass that is an unstoppable force. Before the bigot, misogyny or homophobia accusation is used: No one has anything against gay, trans, black or diverse characters and this was also the case 20 years ago. Just as reminder: Remember anyone criticizing Moff Gideon, Cere Junda (Fallen Order), Lando Calrissian, Mace Windu or Dr. Aphra (comics)? No, because they are awesome characters and we want them to return in new stories. Instead we dislike boring or one dimensional characters, weak stories and misuse of characters we grew up and liked for years. Sadly Obi Wan has a lot of weaknesses. It does also not help that you know the outcomes. They cant kill or seriously harm a character that appears later in the movies. The main example is the final episode and the climax battles where no one could die. Just a few additional examples. In one a familiar character is threaten with death by light saber and there is an interrogation with seemingly dire consequences. Both fail because you know no one could die. Another example: The Grand Inquisitor has an awesome arc in Rebels which happens chronologically after the events of this show and I say they give the character redemption there so you can see the outcome from a mile away. Continuity wise there are a few problems too: The knowledge that Darth Vader was Anakin Skywalker is a huge secret only a few know and anyone who talks about it will die swiftly. He even killed his own squad when a fugitive Jedi spoiled this to them if I remember correctly. Also a certain Imperial base that is majorly important has no defense mechanisms. The general story feels often like doing check marks on a to do list. Insert Darth Vader here, a familiar character there, show the base from Fallen Order, tease this and that. When you look behind this attempt to bait nostalgia it is a weak show. Only episode 5 is anywhere near the quality you need and even it is sometimes silly and unbelievable. The final has some great moments that feel like Star Wars and I freely admit this. Then there are plot holes like my prime example: Entering a hugely protected secretive base without any reason to be there as subtle as a jack hammer (Making suspicious radio messages near other imperials), escaping while hundred of armed soldiers aim at you at an important base without defense weapons nor star fighters or changes of characters decisions because of a small dialogues that should not work (Roken helping Obi Wan). Also no one during the show notice Obi Wans face even when he is on the top wanted list and actively searched when he reappears or later that he hides a child under his imperial uniforms cloak and hundred of people fail to notice. Lets end this point here. I don't blame the actors for a weak script and misuse of the characters. I even enjoyed Reva especially after they get character development towards the end but they weaken her before with bad writing and predictability. I knew / predicted her backstory immediately. Also name something that defines her character outside her hate and obsession before the last 2 episodes. As example for the poor writing: Reva forgot that her light saber can open a blast door in seconds until it is needed storywise or that a dozen or more stormtroppers are in hearing distance when she talks to Obi Wan things that could harm her badly. This level of writing makes her look incompetent. Now imagine how her backstory and development would be handled by a more competed writer. She would be a fan and critic favorite. Maybe the show was too long in development struggles as it should be a movie, was rumored to be canceled and more. So I will not criticize anything further in this regard. Then there are moronic decisions by the characters like being unable to use the Imperial resources when necessary (reinforcement, ships, surveillance etc.), no one figures out guarding a dangerous prisoner with just 4 stormtroopers is moronic or sending an undecoded message that contains all information to be crucified if it gets in the wrong hands. Then there are the abrupt character competences changes like Obi Wan not being able to use the force without reasons (other than the script) but later going one man (Jedi) army. Darth Vader is later also affected by this and forgets he has his ship in orbit. The special effects are good as expected as are the fights (except an early one which breaks Obi Wan). Overall this was a disappointment and is not recommend for fans of Star Wars. Mandalorian shows how to do Star Wars right and outclasses this show on any level.

Ewan Mcgreggor seems to have forgotten how to Obi-Wan, delivering a dry and serious performance, Moses Ingrams 2 dimensional character was just terrible with no depth and badly acted, weird things like why the main characters couldn't just walk around something, to the show creating problems for itself with Leia and Obi-Wan apparently knowing him and then not even caring about his death in the original movies. And when was he able to control that much force?\n\nBut there were positives. It was great to see Hayden Christianson return as Vader, and seeing more vader in general is always a good thing. The Leia actress was also great, although she seemed very young for 10. I also enjoyed more background on the Lars family.\n\nI think with a second season it could answer a few of these questions and raise the bar a little. But this wasn't a great first season.

The cinematography, production and choreography was lazy, and the show dragged like crazy.

Reva parkouring on the roofs without getting anywhere or giving us any new information is also a weird choice. Scene was also too long. In my opinion it doesn't help the character.
